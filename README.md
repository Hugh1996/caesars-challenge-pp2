  - Red was chosen as the main color throughout the site due its historical signficance as the main color of the Roman army, symbolizing their god of war, Mars. The colors association with war and battle aligns well with the context of the website, given that its a quiz based on a historically violent empire.

  - Additionally, red being an attractive, attention-grabbing color is also an important consideration to catch the users eye, particularly for the central quiz container.

  - The use of black text to contrast with the dominant red color, ensures the text is easily readable for the user.

  - All buttons have a white background. White was chosen due to its clean aesthethic while ensuring they stand out against the red background and black text, to maintain readability.

  - Each button has a hover effect to transform from white into Roman imperial purple. This continues with the theme of historical accuracy throughout the site. The cursor also changes to a sword when hovering over the button. These both help to reinforce the interacivity of the bottons.

  - The Libre Bodoni font is the main font used throughout the website, chosen for its elegant style. There is a fallback of Sans Serif, should the font not be imported correctly.
